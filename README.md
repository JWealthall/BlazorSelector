# Blazor Selector

This is a just a fun project for my team to:
- Show how Blazor can be used for *simple* animations to randomly select a name from a list
- Help to learn Blazor
- Create a bit of coding/artistic competition

## The Rules

- Must be in Blazor (*obviously*)
- Cannot use JavaScript
- You can only change your own name/nickname

Other than that pretty much anything goes - so long as it helps us all learn Blazor.

## Notes

There is a basic service which can provide the names.  These names are provided from a JSON file in sample-data.
Each person has a nickname, full name and initials - and the data is selected in that order for each person.

I set the bar really low with the first example (basic grid) - No custom components, no images/graphics.
I hoping to see some clever uses of Blazor - animated gifs? vector graphics?
